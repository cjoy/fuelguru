## Petrol GURU
Fuel Guru is a user friendly web app which allows users to easily find fuel stations which fit their needs. Whether they want cheap petrol, nearby fuel stations, electric car recharging or a petrol station en route to a destination, this app will be able to provide them with viable options. An underpinning feature of this system is that the listed prices are accurate and up-to-date. The accuracy of this information is crucial to the success of Fuel Guru, and so will be taken from the New South Wales Government fuel API.
